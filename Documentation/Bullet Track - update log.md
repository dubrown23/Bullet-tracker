  - Changed from `NSPersistentContainer` to `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer`
  - Added Remote Notifications background capability
  - Configured persistent store for CloudKit with history tracking
  - Fixed "BUG IN CLIENT OF CLOUDKIT" error by enabling remote notifications
  - Successfully tested automatic sync between two physical devices
- **Added iCloud Sync toggle in Settings**:
  - New "Sync" section in SettingsView with enable/disable toggle
  - Sync preference saved to UserDefaults
  - CoreDataManager dynamically chooses CloudKit or local storage based on setting
  - Visual indicator showing sync status when enabled

## Notes Section
Use this section to track ongoing issues, decisions made, or important context:

### Current Known Issues
- Dark mode color consistency needs review
- Performance optimization needed for large datasets
- iCloud sync setting changes require app restart (Core Data limitation)

### Architecture Decisions
- Using JSON in Core Data details field for flexibility
- Multi-state tracking via dynamic Core Data properties
- Backup system uses JSON for portability
- CloudKit container used when sync enabled, local container when disabled
- Default sync setting is ON for backward compatibility

### Development Reminders
- Always maintain backward compatibility for data formats
- Test multi-state cycling thoroughly
- Verify statistics calculations with edge cases
- Test iCloud sync with multiple devices before release
- Consider adding deduplication logic for future updates

### iCloud Sync Specific Notes
- Both devices must be signed into same iCloud account
- iCloud Drive must be enabled in device settings
- Initial sync may take 30-60 seconds
- Sync happens automatically in background
- No UI required for basic sync functionality
