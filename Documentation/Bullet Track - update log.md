## Notes Section
Use this section to track ongoing issues, decisions made, or important context:

### Current Known Issues
- Dark mode color consistency needs review
- Performance optimization needed for large datasets
- iCloud sync setting changes require app restart (Core Data limitation)

### Architecture Decisions
- Using JSON in Core Data details field for flexibility
- Multi-state tracking via dynamic Core Data properties
- Backup system uses JSON for portability
- CloudKit container used when sync enabled, local container when disabled
- Default sync setting is ON for backward compatibility
- Special project files (Assets, Core Data model, entitlements) kept in Bullet Tracker folder for Xcode compatibility
- Traffic light color system provides universal understanding while habit colors maintain identity
- Negative habits use simple toggle (no multi-state) with red X indicator

### Development Reminders
- Always maintain backward compatibility for data formats
- Test multi-state cycling thoroughly
- Verify statistics calculations with edge cases
- Test iCloud sync with multiple devices before release
- Consider adding deduplication logic for future updates
- When reorganizing files, use Xcode navigator only (never Finder)
- Create Groups not Folder References for code organization
- Test workout detail conditions with both multi-state and single-state habits
- When adding Core Data attributes, use lightweight migration with default values

### iCloud Sync Specific Notes
- Both devices must be signed into same iCloud account
- iCloud Drive must be enabled in device settings
- Initial sync may take 30-60 seconds
- Sync happens automatically in background
- No UI required for basic sync functionality

### Project Organization Notes (Added 05.31.2025)
- All Swift files organized into logical groups
- Special files (Assets.xcassets, .xcdatamodeld, .entitlements) remain in Bullet Tracker folder
- Groups are virtual folders for organization, not physical directories
- File moves must be done through Xcode to maintain references
- Build and test after each major file reorganization

### UI/UX Decisions (Added 06.01.2025)
- Tap behavior depends on habit settings: detail-tracking habits open Log Details, others cycle states
- Traffic light colors (green/yellow/red) provide immediate visual feedback
- Workout details only appear for success state to reduce clutter for partial/failed attempts
- Structured note format guides users while allowing flexibility
- Removed redundant UI elements (pencil icon, explanation text) for cleaner interface
- Negative habits show red X when checked to indicate failure/relapse
- Workout type selection uses 2-column grid with native LazyVGrid
- Duration picker includes +5 button for granular control beyond preset options
