## 05.31.2025 - Project Structure Reorganization
- **Completed major code reorganization**:
  - Reorganized 31+ Swift files from flat structure into logical groups

  - Extensions: Helper extensions (Color+Hex)
  - Resources: Assets catalog
- **Resolved build issues**:
  - Fixed missing entitlements file error after reorganization
  - Learned that special project files (Assets.xcassets, Core Data model, entitlements) must remain in specific locations
  - Successfully maintained all app functionality after reorganization

## 06.01.2025 - Habit Entry Editing, UI Enhancements & Negative Habits
- **Fixed habit entry editing access**:
  - Modified HabitCheckboxView to open Log Details on tap for habits with detail tracking enabled
  - Preserved tap-to-cycle behavior for habits without detail tracking
  - Added logic to always open details for already-filled entries instead of cycling states
  - Resolved issue where users couldn't edit existing entry details
- **Implemented traffic light color system**:
  - Changed from habit color for success to universal green/yellow/red system
  - Created hybrid approach: traffic light colors for fill, habit color for border
  - Success = Green, Partial = Yellow, Attempted = Red
  - Maintained habit identity through colored border ring
- **UI improvements**:
  - Removed redundant pencil edit icon from HabitTrackerView
  - Removed verbose state explanation text ("Formal workout completed", etc.)

  - Implemented FlowLayout for responsive button arrangement
  - Changed duration picker to use native SwiftUI picker with common intervals
  - Added conditional display: workout details only show for success state
- **Workout note formatting**:
  - Implemented structured note format: "75 min\nCardio:\nStrength:"
  - Auto-populates duration and selected workout types with colons
  - Allows users to add specific details after each workout type
  - Preserves user-entered content when workout selections change

  - Only displays when an entry exists
  - Allows users to delete an entry completely from within the detail view

  - Retained common duration options (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 min)
  - Allows incremental additions for any duration (95, 100, 105+ minutes)
  - Removed 120 min option for cleaner UI
- **Implemented negative habits feature**:
  - Added "isNegativeHabit" Boolean attribute to Core Data Habit entity

## 06.01.2025 - Navigation Restructuring & Collection Cleanup
- **Removed collection relationship from habits**:
  - Cleaned up AddHabitView by removing collection picker and related state
  - Cleaned up EditHabitView by removing collection picker and related state
  - Set collection parameter to nil in create/update calls
  - Removed unnecessary methods: loadCollections(), preSelectHabitTrackerCollection()
  - Simplified both forms to focus on habit configuration only
- **Reorganized app navigation structure**:
  - Elevated Habit Tracker from Collections to main tab bar
  - Added Habits as second tab with chart.bar.fill icon
  - Moved Index from main tabs to Special Collections section
  - Created 4-tab structure: Daily, Habits, Collections, Settings
- **Updated Collections view**:
  - Replaced Habit Tracker with Index in Special Collections
  - Index now uses doc.text.magnifyingglass icon
  - Updated subtitle to "Search and browse all entries"
  - Maintains special collections + user collections structure
- **Improved app flow**:
  - Direct access to habits without navigating through Collections
  - Index still accessible but doesn't clutter main navigation
  - Cleaner conceptual model: habits are centralized, not scattered
  - Better aligns with app's habit-first philosophy

## 06.03.2025 - Delete Habit Bug Fix & Date Update Fix (In Progress)
- **Fixed delete habit flow issue**:
  - Problem: Selecting delete from context menu opened edit view instead of showing delete confirmation
  - Added separate `habitToDelete` property to HabitTrackerViewModel
  - Updated context menu to use `habitToDelete` instead of `selectedHabit` for deletion
  - Now delete shows confirmation alert directly without opening edit sheet
  - Edit and delete actions now properly separated
- **Date update bug fix (in testing)**:
  - Problem: Habit tracker stuck on previous day when app remains open overnight
  - Initial fix using `.onAppear` didn't work due to TabView behavior
  - Implemented solution using `scenePhase` environment variable
  - Monitors when app becomes active and checks if date changed
  - Updates to current date automatically without requiring app restart
  - Created separate fix document for testing reference

## Notes Section
Use this section to track ongoing issues, decisions made, or important context:

### Current Known Issues
- Dark mode color consistency needs review
- Performance optimization needed for large datasets
- iCloud sync setting changes require app restart (Core Data limitation)

### Architecture Decisions
- Using JSON in Core Data details field for flexibility
- Multi-state tracking via dynamic Core Data properties
- Backup system uses JSON for portability
- CloudKit container used when sync enabled, local container when disabled
- Default sync setting is ON for backward compatibility
- Special project files (Assets, Core Data model, entitlements) kept in Bullet Tracker folder for Xcode compatibility
- Traffic light color system provides universal understanding while habit colors maintain identity
- Negative habits use simple toggle (no multi-state) with red X indicator

### Development Reminders
- Always maintain backward compatibility for data formats
- Test multi-state cycling thoroughly
- Verify statistics calculations with edge cases
- Test iCloud sync with multiple devices before release
- Consider adding deduplication logic for future updates
- When reorganizing files, use Xcode navigator only (never Finder)
- Create Groups not Folder References for code organization
- Test workout detail conditions with both multi-state and single-state habits
- When adding Core Data attributes, use lightweight migration with default values

### iCloud Sync Specific Notes
- Both devices must be signed into same iCloud account
- iCloud Drive must be enabled in device settings
- Initial sync may take 30-60 seconds
- Sync happens automatically in background
- No UI required for basic sync functionality

### Project Organization Notes (Added 05.31.2025)
- All Swift files organized into logical groups
- Special files (Assets.xcassets, .xcdatamodeld, .entitlements) remain in Bullet Tracker folder
- Groups are virtual folders for organization, not physical directories
- File moves must be done through Xcode to maintain references
- Build and test after each major file reorganization

### UI/UX Decisions (Added 06.01.2025)
- Tap behavior depends on habit settings: detail-tracking habits open Log Details, others cycle states
- Traffic light colors (green/yellow/red) provide immediate visual feedback
- Workout details only appear for success state to reduce clutter for partial/failed attempts
- Structured note format guides users while allowing flexibility
- Removed redundant UI elements (pencil icon, explanation text) for cleaner interface
- Negative habits show red X when checked to indicate failure/relapse
- Workout type selection uses 2-column grid with native LazyVGrid
- Duration picker includes +5 button for granular control beyond preset options
